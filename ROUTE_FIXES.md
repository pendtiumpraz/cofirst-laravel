# Route Fixes Summary

## Fixed Routes

1. **Teacher Schedule Route**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/teacher/dashboard.blade.php`
   - Changed from: `teacher.schedules.index`
   - Changed to: `admin.schedules.index`
   - Reason: Teachers don't have their own schedule routes, they use admin routes

2. **Teacher Attendance Routes**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/teacher/dashboard.blade.php`
   - Changed from: `teacher.attendance.today` and `teacher.attendance.index`
   - Changed to: `#` (placeholder)
   - Reason: Attendance feature not yet implemented

3. **Student Material Routes**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/student/curriculum/show.blade.php`
   - Changed from: `student.materials.download` and `student.materials.show`
   - Changed to: `admin.materials.download` and `admin.materials.show`
   - Reason: Material routes are shared through admin namespace

4. **Finance Dashboard Route**
   - Fixed in: `routes/web.php`
   - Changed from: `finance.dashboard`
   - Changed to: `dashboard`
   - Reason: Finance role uses the main dashboard, not a separate one

5. **Admin Badge Management Routes**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` and all badge views
   - Changed from: `admin.badges.*` and `gamification.badges`
   - Changed to: `badges.*`
   - Reason: Badge routes are not prefixed with admin

6. **Admin Reward Management Routes**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
   - Changed from: `admin.rewards.*` and `gamification.rewards`
   - Changed to: `rewards.*`
   - Reason: Reward routes are not prefixed with admin

7. **Admin Redemptions Route**
   - Fixed in: `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`
   - Changed from: `admin.reward-redemptions.*` and `gamification.redemptions`
   - Changed to: `reward-redemptions.*`
   - Reason: Redemption routes use different naming

## Routes Now Implemented (Previously Using Placeholders)

These routes have been implemented with placeholder controllers and basic views:

### Admin Routes
1. **Class Photos** - `admin.class-photos.*`
2. **Certificate Templates** - `admin.certificate-templates.*`
3. **Certificate Bulk Generate** - `admin.certificates.bulk-generate`
4. **Testimonials Management** - `admin.testimonials.*`

### Teacher Routes
1. **Class Photos** - `teacher.class-photos.*`
2. **Certificate Generation** - `teacher.certificates.generate`
3. **Student Progress** (gamification) - `teacher.student-progress.*`
4. **Student Handover** - `teacher.handovers.*`
5. **Attendance** - `teacher.attendance.*` (placeholder for future)

### Parent Routes
1. **Class Photos** - `parent.class-photos.*`
2. **Contact Admin** - `parent.contact-admin`
3. **Submit Testimonials** - `parent.testimonials.*`

All these routes now have working controllers that display "coming soon" messages and return appropriate views.
